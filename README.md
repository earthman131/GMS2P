# GMS2P

Modified interpolation-iteration continuation method for gravity and magnetic data

Developed by Lianghui Guo

# Principles


GMS2P is a MatLab code for gravity or magnetic anomaly continuation from the undulating surface to the plane. It can provide gravity or magnetic data on horizontal plane for data processing and inversion in frequency domain. Based on the theory of conventional interpolation-iteration method, we proposed a modified interpolation-iteration method by introducing a correction factor of undulating observation surface in the iterative process of anomaly correction. The improved method accelerates the iterative convergence speed and promote the effect of continuation. The theoretical model shows that this method is stable and effective, and suitable for the complex conditions of observation surface undulating terribly and big-span continuation. The result presented by this method is better than the conventional interpolation-iteration method.

# Prerequisites

The code being implemented in MATLAB, it requires the MATLAB software, which is licensed under the MathWorks sofware company. MATLAB can be downloaded at the following link https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/, and more information can be found about the license fee on the website.

# Usage

To launch the program, it just requires to dowload ‘Matlab_Code’ from my repositories and execute the script GMS2P.m on MATLAB.
